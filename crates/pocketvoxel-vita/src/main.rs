// Single-threaded guest state behind `static mut`, the established style on
// the sibling hosts (crates/pocketvoxel-psp/src/main.rs).
#![allow(static_mut_refs)]

//! VOXELMON on the PS Vita: the full Pocket Voxel composition on the second
//! machine (docs/VOXEL.md §2, §8).
//!
//! Per frame (one guest turn per tick, §3/§7):
//!   pad -> `frame(buttons)` in QuickJS (the TypeScript gameplay port; its
//!   ops apply synchronously into the shared Scene through `voxel.*`) ->
//!   microtasks -> `scene.tick()` -> `draw::build` -> the vitaGL backend ->
//!   `vglSwapBuffers` -> `audio_pump`.
//!
//! Same guest bundle, same pak, same core as the PSP EBOOT — what changes is
//! the rung and the raster. The host names its quality rung
//! (`op::QUALITY`, contracts/spec/voxel-spec.ts §quality ladder) rather than
//! the guest, which is why one bundle serves both machines; and the logical
//! viewport stays 480x272 while the physical one is 960x544, so the picture
//! is the PSP's layout at four times the pixels.
//!
//! Buttons: CIRCLE confirms (A), CROSS cancels (B) — the same choice the
//! EBOOT makes, so a player with the rest of the family on their stick does
//! not find A dead here.
//!
//! Memory: the 32 MB pak is a FILE next to the executable inside the VPK
//! (never include_bytes! — a 32 MB `.rodata` array is a self-inflicted link
//! and load cost), staged into one 16-byte-aligned heap block whose vertex
//! and index pools then become GL buffer objects. Unlike the PSP there is no
//! partition to husband: the Vita's user RAM is measured in hundreds of
//! megabytes.
