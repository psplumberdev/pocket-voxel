//! VOXELMON on the PSP: the full Pocket Voxel composition (docs/VOXEL.md).
//!
//! Per frame (one guest turn per tick, §3/§7):
//!   pad → `frame(buttons)` in QuickJS (the TypeScript gameplay port; its
//!   ops apply synchronously into the shared Scene through `voxel.*`) →
//!   microtasks → `audio_pump` → `scene.tick()` → `draw::build` →
//!   [pipelined present] → sceGuStart → gu renderer → sceGuFinish.
//!
//! Sound leaves through the audio MODULE (contracts/spec/audio.ts), not the
//! `voxel` surface: the guest emits audio intent as ops, the core's chip
//! synth interprets the pak's channel programs, and `audio_pump` renders the
//! ring's frames on this side of the JS boundary.
//!
//! Boot skeleton follows openstrike-psp/main.rs (1 MB VFPU worker thread,
//! arena allocator installed by linking pocketjs-psp, full 333 MHz clocks —
//! PSPLINK inherits 222 MHz and a QuickJS guest feels every missing cycle).
//!
//! Buttons: CIRCLE confirms (A), CROSS cancels (B) — the pocketmon lesson
//! (98f035d): every other PocketJS host presses on CIRCLE, and a player
//! with the rest of the family on their stick must not find A dead here.
//!
//! Memory: the 21 MB pak is loaded from a FILE next to the EBOOT into one
//! reused 16-aligned buffer (the OpenStrike maps.rs pattern) — NEVER
//! include_bytes!. A PSP-1000's 24 MB user partition cannot hold the pak
//! plus the QuickJS heap, so the current pak is slim/PPSSPP-only:
//! tools/voxel.ts stamps MEMSIZE=1 into the PARAM.SFO (full PSP-2000 64 MB
//! under PPSSPP and CFW slims). Streaming chunks from the pak file is the
//! flagged follow-up for fat hardware.
