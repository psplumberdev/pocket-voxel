//! The per-frame draw list: one ordered, backend-neutral description of the
//! frame, built from the retained scene + the pak. The software rasterizer
//! (`pocketvoxel-sim`) and the future sceGu backend consume the same items,
//! so everything positional — billboard lean, camera-ward pull, culling,
//! draw order — is decided HERE, once.
//!
//! Draw order (docs/VOXEL.md §3, the mod minus shader-bound passes):
//! sky bands → terrain chunks (+ stamps) → water → shadow decals → player
//! ghost (inverted depth, no write) → entity cards → grass → flower → GB UI
//! → native screen-space overlay.
//! Stamps are terrain sub-meshes and draw in the terrain pass. The `walker`
//! entity flag needs no ordering here: every card already draws before the
//! grass mesh, which is what grants grass its occlusion of walker feet.
