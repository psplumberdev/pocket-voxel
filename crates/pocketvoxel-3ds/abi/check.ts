/**
 * The C half of this crate's verification: cross-build the staticlib, then
 * compile and link `abi_probe.c` against it with devkitARM.
 *
 *   bun crates/pocketvoxel-3ds/abi/check.ts
 *
 * Two things fail here that nothing on the host can catch:
 *
 *  - a struct whose size or field offsets differ on 32-bit ARM from the
 *    numbers `src/tests.rs` asserts (every `_Static_assert` in the probe);
 *  - a header that declares an entry point the archive does not export, or
 *    exports with a different C signature.
 *
 * devkitARM lives in the `devkitpro/devkitarm` image, which is native
 * linux/arm64 on Apple silicon and safe to run concurrently. Nothing is
 * written outside the container's /tmp.
