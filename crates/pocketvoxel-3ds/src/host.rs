//! The runtime state one Pocket Voxel process holds on the 3DS: the retained
//! [`Scene`] the guest drives, the pak's borrowed sections, and the counters.
//!
//! This is the ownership split of `crates/pocketvoxel-psp/src/main.rs` with
//! the QuickJS half handed to C (see [`crate::voxel`]). What stayed here is
//! everything that decides what the frame contains:
//!
//! ```text
//! pak -> Scene <- guest ops        (crate::voxel, dispatched below)
//!         |
//!         +-- tick()               the only clock in the runtime
//!         +-- draw::build()        the DrawList both other backends consume
//!               |
//!               +-- pocketvoxel_pica::Renderer::record()
//! ```
//!
//! Nothing here touches the GPU, allocates linear memory or owns the frame
//! lifecycle; the C side does, through `pocketvoxel_pica.h`.
