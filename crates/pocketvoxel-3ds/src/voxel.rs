//! The `voxel` surface: the op table the guest's `globalThis.voxel` is built
//! from, and the argument marshalling every op goes through.
//!
//! This is `crates/pocketvoxel-psp/src/voxel.rs` transcribed. That file is
//! authoritative for **op numbers, arities and semantics**, and the two hosts
//! must present the same surface or the same guest bundle stops meaning the
//! same thing on the two consoles. What differs here is only where the JSValue
//! unwrapping happens: the PSP registers QuickJS C functions from Rust, while
//! the 3DS host follows `hosts/3ds/src/qjs.c` and does it in C, so this module
//! publishes the table as **data** and the C side walks it.
//!
//! Two consequences of that transcription worth stating, because both look
//! like bugs and neither is:
//!
//! - **A missing argument reads as 0.** The PSP host collects exactly the op's
//!   declared arity through `arg_i32`, which answers 0 past the guest's own
//!   `argc`, and hands `scene.op` a full argument list every time. So
//!   `voxel.cam(4)` moves the camera to (4, 0) instead of throwing. Native
//!   hosts are the non-strict kind (`framework/src/host.ts`), and the core's
//!   dispatch is defensive by contract because the op stream crosses a trust
//!   boundary.
//! - **`mapShow` reads argument 0 before dispatch.** Slot 0 re-showing is a
//!   warp landing, which is the one moment a long garbage collection is an
//!   invisible held cut; the flag is set from the same defaulted argument, so
//!   `voxel.mapShow()` with no arguments trips it exactly as the PSP host
//!   does.
//!
//! There is deliberately **no `quality` op**: the PSP EBOOT registers none and
//! so runs tier 0, the `psp` rung, and this host does the same. See
//! [`crate::host::Host::new`].
