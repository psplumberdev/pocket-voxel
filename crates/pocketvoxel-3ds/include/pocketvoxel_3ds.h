/*
 * pocketvoxel_3ds.h — the C ABI of `libpocketvoxel_3ds.a`, the Rust glue that
 * owns the Pocket Voxel guest surface, the retained Scene and the pak on the
 * Nintendo 3DS.
 *
 * Ownership, ported from crates/pocketvoxel-psp (the EBOOT):
 *
 *   Rust owns  the pak (parse, validation, the borrowed sections), the
 *              retained Scene, the `voxel` op table and its argument
 *              marshalling, the per-present draw::build, and the handover to
 *              pocketvoxel-pica.
 *   C owns     QuickJS (runtime, context, the guest bundle, globalThis.frame),
 *              citro3d, linearAlloc, the frame lifecycle, input, present.
 *
 * That is the opposite of the PSP split for QuickJS, and it matches the
 * PocketJS 3DS host (hosts/3ds/src/qjs.c): C unwraps JSValues and calls plain
 * C entry points, so **no JSValue ever crosses this boundary** and the 16-byte
 * JS_NO_NAN_BOXING JSValue ABI cannot be got wrong in two places.
 *
 * The op numbers, arities and semantics below are `crates/pocketvoxel-psp/src/
 * voxel.rs` transcribed, not re-derived. Op codes are append-only
 * (contracts/spec/voxel-spec.ts); nothing here renumbers them.
 *
 * The rendered frame is NOT handed over through this header: pv3ds_present()
 * records into pocketvoxel-pica, and the C side reads the command stream
 * through `pv_pica_frame()` in crates/pocketvoxel-pica/include/
 * pocketvoxel_pica.h, which also documents the GPU state each command means.

 *   4. pv3ds_load_pak(blob, len)
 *   5. create the QuickJS runtime, register globalThis.voxel (below), eval the

 *
 * Step 3 before step 5 for the same reason the PSP EBOOT loads its pak first:
 * the pak is the single largest allocation of the run (32 MB for the shipped
 * one) and the QuickJS heap has to fit in what remains. On the 3DS the split
 * that decides "what remains" is fixed before main() — libctru carves the
 * linear heap out of APPMEMALLOC at startup and the rest becomes the malloc
 * heap — so the C side must size `__ctru_linear_heap_size` for the arena plus
