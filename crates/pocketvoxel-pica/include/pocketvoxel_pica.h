/*
 * pocketvoxel_pica.h — the C side of the Pocket Voxel PICA200 backend.
 *
 * The split, and why it is this way round: citro3d is a C library that is
 * largely `static inline`, so unlike the PSP (where `pocketvoxel-gu` calls
 * sceGu from Rust) the 3DS puts the GPU calls in C. **Rust resolves the
 * frame, C issues the citro3d calls.**
 *
 *   Rust owns  the pak, the DrawList, the frame lowering, the texel layout.
 *   C owns     citro3d, linearAlloc, the C3D_Tex array, the frame lifecycle,
 *              present.
 *
 * Recording is driven from the host's own Rust glue, which owns the QuickJS
 * guest and the retained Scene:
 *
 *     pocketvoxel_pica::global().record(&draw::build(&scene, pak), pak)
 *
 * The C side then reads what it recorded through pv_pica_frame() and walks
 * the commands in order. Nothing here draws, allocates linear memory, or
 * decides when a frame begins.
 *
 * Every struct below is mirrored by a #[repr(C)] type in the crate, and the
 * crate const-asserts the sizes.

/* ==========================================================================
 * What the C side must set up
 * ==========================================================================
 *
 * 1. FRAME-CONSTANT STATE
 *
 *      C3D_CullFace(GPU_CULL_NONE);
 *
 *    Back-face culling is FORBIDDEN, not merely unset: the cooked streams do
 *    not share one winding (column tops, gables, water and grass slabs are
 *    each emitted in their own order), so any single cull mode eats faces
 *    that should stay. The honest fix is geometric, at cook time.
 *
 *      C3D_DepthMap(true, -1.0f, 0.0f);
 *
 *    The matrices already carry the GL -> PICA depth remap (GL clip z in
 *    [-w, w] becomes [-w, 0]), so with this depth map the near plane lands at
 *    depth 1 and the far plane at 0. "Nearer wins" is therefore GPU_GREATER —
 *    C3D_Init's own default — the clear depth is 0, and an equal-depth
 *    contest goes to whichever draw came FIRST, which is what the software
 *    rasterizer's strict `z < depth` does and why draw order must never be
 *    disturbed.
 *
 * 2. PER-COMMAND STATE
 *
 *      depth NONE        C3D_DepthTest(false, GPU_ALWAYS, GPU_WRITE_COLOR)
 *      depth TEST_WRITE  C3D_DepthTest(true, GPU_GREATER, GPU_WRITE_ALL)
 *      depth TEST        C3D_DepthTest(true, GPU_GREATER, GPU_WRITE_COLOR)
 *      depth INVERTED    C3D_DepthTest(true, GPU_LESS,    GPU_WRITE_COLOR)
 *
 *      F_ALPHA_TEST      C3D_AlphaTest(true, GPU_GREATER, 0x7f)
 *      F_BLEND           C3D_AlphaBlend(GPU_BLEND_ADD, GPU_BLEND_ADD,
 *                          GPU_SRC_ALPHA, GPU_ONE_MINUS_SRC_ALPHA,
 *                          GPU_SRC_ALPHA, GPU_ONE_MINUS_SRC_ALPHA)
 *
 *    RGBA5551 carries one alpha bit, which expands to 0 or 255, so the alpha
 *    test at 0x7f discards exactly the texels whose palette alpha was < 0x80
 *    — the software rasterizer's own cutoff. A discarded texel writes neither
 *    colour nor depth, which the depth test gives for free.
 *
 * 3. TEV
 *
 *      textured:    RGB = texture0 * primary colour, ALPHA = texture0
 *      untextured:  RGB and ALPHA = primary colour
 *
 *    Taking ALPHA from the texture alone (not modulated by the vertex colour)
 *    is deliberate: it makes the alpha test the TEXEL test the rasterizer
 *    performs, whatever a vertex's baked AO alpha happens to be.
 *
 * 4. SAMPLER
 *
 *      C3D_TexSetFilter(&tex, GPU_NEAREST, GPU_NEAREST);
 *      C3D_TexSetWrap(&tex, GPU_CLAMP_TO_EDGE, GPU_CLAMP_TO_EDGE);
 *
 *    Pixel art, and the pak cooks no mips. Linear filtering would blend
 *    content with the POT padding along the content's edges; a repeat wrap
 *    would pull that padding in from the opposite side.
 *
 * 5. ATTRIBUTES — two configurations, switched when PvPicaCmd.vfmt changes.
 *    Both vertices are 16 bytes.
 *
 *      AttrInfo_Init(&world);
 *      AttrInfo_AddLoader(&world, 0, GPU_SHORT, 3);         // v0 position
 *      AttrInfo_AddLoader(&world, 1, GPU_SHORT, 2);         // v1 texcoord
 *      AttrInfo_AddLoader(&world, 2, GPU_UNSIGNED_BYTE, 4); // v2 colour
 *      // buffer order is [texcoord][colour][position] -> permutation 0x021
 *
 *      AttrInfo_Init(&flat);
 *      AttrInfo_AddLoader(&flat, 0, GPU_FLOAT, 3);          // v0 position
 *      AttrInfo_AddFixed(&flat, 1);                         // v1 unused
 *      AttrInfo_AddLoader(&flat, 2, GPU_UNSIGNED_BYTE, 4);  // v2 colour
 *      // buffer order is [position][colour] -> permutation 0x20
 *
 *    s16 attributes convert to float as RAW INTEGERS — there is no implicit
 *    division by 32768 like the PSP GE's TRANSFORM_3D. That is why positions
 *    arrive in world pixels with no counter-scale in the model matrix, and
 *    why texcoords need PvPicaCmd.uv_scale.
 *
 * 6. THE VERTEX SHADER
 *
 *      gl_Position   = mtx * vec4(position, 1.0)
 *      out texcoord  = texcoord * uv_scale
 *      out colour    = colour
 *
 *    `mtx` is one uniform, uploaded per command from PvPicaFrame.matrices;
 *    `uv_scale` is a second. Remember picasso freezes the PICA200 on two
 *    consecutive `mova`, and only one input register may be referenced across
 *    one instruction's source operands.
 *
 * 7. THE SCREEN TILT — the one thing this crate deliberately does NOT fold in
 *
 *    The matrices are LANDSCAPE-space with the PICA depth mapping already
 *    applied. The 3DS render target is created rotated
 *    (C3D_RenderTargetCreate(240, 400, ...)), and citro3d's *Tilt matrices
 *    carry the rotation that compensates. This crate cannot build that
 *    rotation without guessing its sign, so the C side pre-multiplies it once
 *    per frame over the (small, deduplicated) matrix table:
 *
 *      C3D_Mtx tilt;
 *      Mtx_OrthoTilt(&tilt, -1.0f, 1.0f, -1.0f, 1.0f, 0.0f, 1.0f, true);
 *      // Mtx_Ortho over [-1,1]^2 is the identity in x and y, so OrthoTilt
 *      // over those bounds IS the tilt. Force the z and w rows back to the
 *      // identity so the depth mapping this crate applied survives.
 *      tilt.r[2].x = 0; tilt.r[2].y = 0; tilt.r[2].z = 1; tilt.r[2].w = 0;
 *      tilt.r[3].x = 0; tilt.r[3].y = 0; tilt.r[3].z = 0; tilt.r[3].w = 1;
 *
 *      for (uint32_t i = 0; i < f->matrix_count; i++) {
 *        C3D_Mtx m;
 *        memcpy(m.m, f->matrices + i * 16, sizeof m.m);
 *        Mtx_Multiply(&uploaded[i], &tilt, &m);
 *      }
 *
 *    C3D_Mtx is row-major and each row is a C3D_FVec, which citro3d declares
 *    as `struct { float w, z, y, x; }` — so C3D_Mtx.m[] is row-major with the
 *    components of each row REVERSED. The matrices here are already in that
 *    order, which is why the memcpy above is correct and a transpose would
 *    not be.
 *
 * ==========================================================================
 * The draw loop
 * ==========================================================================
 *
 *   const PvPicaFrame *f = pv_pica_frame();
 *   for (uint32_t i = 0; i < f->cmd_count; i++) {
 *     const PvPicaCmd *c = &f->cmds[i];
 *     if (c->kind == PV_PICA_CMD_CLEAR) {
 *       // ABGR -> the RGBA8 word C3D_RenderTargetClear wants.
 *       C3D_RenderTargetClear(target, C3D_CLEAR_ALL, abgr_to_rgba8(c->clear_abgr), 0);

 *                                       (c->flags & PV_PICA_F_TINTED) != 0, &need);
 *       if (slot < 0) continue;

 *       C3D_TexBind(0, &textures[slot]);
 *     }
 *     upload_mtx(f->matrices + c->mtx * 16);
 *     upload_uv_scale(c->uv_scale);
 *     C3D_SetAttrInfo(c->vfmt == PV_PICA_VFMT_WORLD ? &world : &flat);

 *                 c->vfmt == PV_PICA_VFMT_WORLD ? 0x021 : 0x20);
