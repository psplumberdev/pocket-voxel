//! Atlas pages → PICA200 textures.
//!
//! The pak stores CLUT8 pages **pre-swizzled for the PSP GE** (16-byte × 8-row
//! blocks) and the day tint is applied by rewriting palette entries. The
//! PICA200 has **no paletted texture format at all**, wants **8×8 tiles in
//! row-major order with the 64 texels of a tile in Morton order**, and accepts
//! only **power-of-two dimensions in [8, 1024]**. Three transforms therefore
//! stand between a page and a bindable texture, and this module owns all
//! three:
//!
//! 1. **Palette expansion.** One texture per `(page, frame, resolved VPAL,
//!    tinted)` — [`TexKey`]. The target format is **RGBA5551**: 16 bpp, and
//!    its single alpha bit is exactly the 1-bit cutout the alpha test needs
//!    (`pocketvoxel-sim`'s rasterizer discards a texel whose palette alpha is
//!    `< 0x80`, writing neither colour nor depth; the same threshold becomes
//!    alpha 0 here and `GPU_GREATER`/`0x7f` on the GPU).
//! 2. **Retile.** PSP 16×8 blocks in, PICA 8×8 Morton tiles out, with the
//!    source **flipped vertically** on the way — tiled row 0 is sampled at
//!    `v = 1`, so the source's top row must land in the LAST tiled row the
//!    rescaled V reaches. Getting only the flip wrong leaves every channel
//!    histogram intact and every pixel misplaced.
//! 3. **POT pad.** Most cooked pages are not power-of-two (terrain 128×184,
//!    pics 40×40 / 48×48 / 56×56), so the texture declares a POT envelope and
//!    reports `u_scale`/`v_scale` for the vertex path to fold into the sampled
//!    coordinate — the same trick `pocketvoxel-gu` plays with `sceGuTexScale`,
//!    which the PICA has no fixed-function equivalent for (see
//!    [`TexPlan::u_scale`]).
//!
//! ## Where the three PICA facts come from
//!
//! The packing, the Morton permutation and the tile order were read out of
//! **devkitPro's own `tex3ds` encoder** rather than from memory: a set of
//! probe images encoded with `tex3ds --raw -z none -f rgba5551` and decoded
//! byte by byte. They are:
//!
//! - a texel is a little-endian `u16`, **`R<<11 | G<<6 | B<<1 | A`**;
//! - within an 8×8 tile, texel `(x, y)` sits at
//!   `(x&1) | ((y&1)<<1) | ((x&2)<<1) | ((y&2)<<2) | ((x&4)<<2) | ((y&4)<<3)`;
//! - tiles run **row-major**, left to right then top to bottom.
//!
//! `tex3ds` performs no vertical flip of its own (it records a sub-rectangle
//! for the non-POT case and leaves V to the app). The flip here is forced by
//! the sampler instead, and [`TexPlan`] derives its placement from that one
//! fact — see [`source_row_of_tiled_row`].
//!
//! ## The one modelled fact
//!
//! How the GPU expands a 5-bit channel back to 8 bits is **modelled**, not
//! measured: [`expand5`] assumes bit replication (`c<<3 | c>>2`), which is
//! what makes `31` read back as pure white. [`TO5`] is derived from
//! [`expand5`] by exhaustive nearest-match, so changing the model is a
//! one-function edit and the table follows. `tex3ds` itself truncates
//! (`c >> 3`, verified 256/256 over a ramp); this module rounds instead,
//! because truncation costs up to **7/255 = 2.7%** per channel and the
//! acceptance run compares against the 8-bit CPU oracle at `-fuzz 2%`.
//! Nearest-under-replication costs at most **4/255 = 1.6%**, which fits.
//!
//! ## The sampler these textures are built for
//!
//! The host sets it once: **nearest** magnification and minification (pixel
//! art, and the pak cooks no mips), **clamp** on both axes, and the alpha
//! test at [`ALPHA_CUTOFF`] — `GPU_GREATER` against `0x7f`, since RGBA5551's
//! one alpha bit expands to 0 or 255. Linear filtering would blend content
//! with [`PAD_TEXEL`] along the content's edges; a repeat wrap would pull the
//! padding in from the opposite side.
