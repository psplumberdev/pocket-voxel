/**
 * The hidden-face cull: faces no camera this runtime can build will ever see
 * from the front, dropped at cook time. The caller's `keepHidden` option
 * restores every face, which is the A/B control the acceptance runs use.
 *
 * **What the cameras can reach.** The field camera has a FIXED AZIMUTH
 * (pocketvoxel-core/src/cam.rs `orbit`): the eye is always
 * `(cx, dist*cos a, cy + dist*sin a)` looking at `(cx, 0, cy)` — due south of
 * the focus, looking north, with only the pitch `a` varying over PITCH_RUNGS
 * (0..75 degrees from straight down) and its tween. The battle rig
 * (cam.rs `battle`) does orbit, and it draws the SAME chunk meshes.
 *
 * **-Y (down) faces below the eye-height floor are unreachable.** A downward
 * face at world y is front-facing only when the eye is BELOW it. Eye height
 * is a function of the rung / rig alone, never of where the player stands:
 * `WORLD_VIEW_H * cos 75deg` = 35.20 px for the field camera, 37.12 px for the
 * tele rig and 27.91 px for the wide rig (both at minimum dolly and zero pitch
 * steer, which only raises the eye). `DOWN_CULL_Y` sits under all three.
 *
 * **-Z (north) faces are NOT unreachable — measured, not assumed.** A
 * north-facing wall is front-facing wherever `z > eye.z = cy + dist*sin a`,
 * and at rung 0 `eye.z` IS the middle of the frame: the southern half of a
 * top-down frame shows the north walls of everything in it. Dropping them
 * moves 16 of the 30 pitch-ladder frames (20916 pixels, worst 7076 in one
 * frame) and breaks the `route-1` story golden. The facing is tagged anyway
 * so the next camera change can be re-measured against it, but it is kept.
 *
 * **Pulled streams are exempt.** draw.rs draws GRASS and FLOWER with a
 * camera-ward `pull` (46 px at rung 0), displacing each vertex along its OWN
 * eye ray — not a rigid transform, so a quad's cooked facing is not its drawn
 * facing. TERRAIN, WATER and the stamps draw with `pull = 0.0` and keep
 * theirs. Culling the pulled streams costs 4380 (grass) + 415 (flower) pixels
 * over the ladder and breaks six story and two battle goldens.
 *
 * A free-roam or orbiting FIELD camera (docs/VOXEL.md §6, "first/third-person
 * free-roam ... are later rungs") must DELETE this optimisation rather than
 * work around it: the pak would be missing faces that camera can reach.
 * Anything that lowers a camera's eye under `DOWN_CULL_Y` — a new rig, a
 * lower `RIG.*.height`, a sixth pitch rung past 75 degrees — invalidates the
 * cooked pak, not just this file.
