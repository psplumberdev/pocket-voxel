/*
 * Pocket Voxel on the Nintendo 3DS: the diorama through the PICA200 instead
 * of a software rasterizer.
 *
 * Per tick, the shape crates/pocketvoxel-psp/src/main.rs drives:
 *
 *   hidScanInput -> globalThis.frame(buttons) in QuickJS -> drain microtasks
 *   -> pv3_tick (Scene::tick, fixed 60 Hz) -> pv3_record (draw::build + the
 *   PICA lowering) -> C3D_FrameBegin / clear / FrameDrawOn / SetViewport ->
 *   the command walk -> C3D_FrameEnd.
 *
 * The render target is created ROTATED — 240 wide by 400 tall — which is how
 * the top screen's framebuffer is laid out; voxel_gfx.c pre-multiplies the
 * screen tilt over the crate's matrix table so the diorama's own landscape
 * coordinates survive.
 *
 * The pak is 480x272 by META and is NOT re-cooked for this screen: VIEW_W and
 * VIEW_H also fix the camera aspect, the UI scale and the sky horizon row. It
 * renders through the existing camera into a 400x226 letterboxed viewport on
 * the 400x240 top screen, which preserves the cooked aspect exactly and costs
 * 7 px of bar top and bottom. The bars carry the sky pass's own clear colour,
 * because that clear covers the whole framebuffer.
 *
 * Every step of that loop names itself in `voxel_host_stage` before it runs,
 * and the two waits the frame makes on the GPU carry deadlines rather than
 * blocking forever. A run that stops therefore leaves a stage, a tick and a
 * set of counters behind — in sdmc:/pocketvoxel-3ds/hb.txt while it is still
 * running, and in the error file if a deadline expires.
 *
 * Building with -DPV3DS_CAPTURE turns this into the deterministic e2e binary:
 * input comes from a baked tape instead of the hardware, only the mark ticks
 * render, each mark's render target is read back into
 * sdmc:/pocketvoxel-3ds/fNNNN.raw, and the process parks instead of exiting
 * so the emulator stays alive for the driver to kill.

 *   ARENA_BANKS   0 means PV3DS_ARENA_BANKS. Two is what makes the rewind
 *                 safe: a present rewinds one bank, so with two banks and a
 *                 loop whose C3D_FrameBegin waits for the command queue to

 *                 whole reachable set is 541 textures / 12.70 MiB, measured

 * What a run that stops leaves behind.
 *
 * A wedged run is not an erroring run: fail() never happens, so no error file
 * is written, the top screen keeps its last frame, and the bottom screen's
 * counter line only refreshes every 30 ticks — a run that stops inside the
 * first 30 says nothing at all about where it stopped.
 *
 * Two cheap things fix that.
 *
 *   THE STAGE is a plain store into a global before each step of the frame:
 *   no syscall, no formatting, no file. A debugger attached to a halted
 *   console reads it directly (`p voxel_host_stage`, `p voxel_host_tick`).
 *   voxel_host_tick is the HOST's tick counter, which is the frame number;
 *   the Scene's own clock is reported next to it.
 *
 *   THE HEARTBEAT spends one truncating SD write to put the same facts in a
 *   file a harness can read over FTP with no debugger at all:
 *   sdmc:/pocketvoxel-3ds/hb.txt, one line, rewritten in place. This is the
 *   PSP capture path's mechanism (crates/pocketvoxel-psp/src/capture.rs
 *   heartbeat()) with the stage and the frame's counters added.
 *
 * A write costs an SD round trip, so writing on every stage change does not
 * hold 60 Hz. That is the trade this build makes: PV3DS_HOST_HEARTBEAT=0
 * turns the file off entirely and leaves the stage store, which is free.
 *
 *   PV3DS_HOST_HEARTBEAT        1 writes the file, 0 does not. A capture build
 *                               defaults to 0 (tools/voxel-3ds.ts): its SD
 *                               directory is the one the e2e driver reads, and
 *                               the golden path keeps exactly the writes it had
 *                               when the goldens were recorded.
 *   PV3DS_HOST_HEARTBEAT_TICKS  the tick cadence. 0 leaves only the

 *                               have advanced. Those counters are incremented
 *                               from libctru's GSP event thread, so this is
 *                               the 60 Hz pacing and it needs the process to
 *                               still be receiving GSP events.
 *   C3Di_WaitAndClearQueue(-1)  blocks until the GX command queue has drained,
 *                               which is the GPU finishing the previous frame.
 *                               That is what makes the arena bank the next
 *                               record rewinds safe to overwrite.
 *
 * A run whose GSP events stop sits in the first forever; a run whose GPU never
 * finishes sits in the second forever. Neither leaves a trace: the top screen
 * keeps its last frame, aptMainLoop is never reached again so HOME does
 * nothing, and nothing is written to the SD card.
 *
 * So each wait keeps its meaning and gains a deadline. The clock is
 * svcGetSystemTick, which runs at SYSCLOCK_ARM11 whatever the CPU is clocked
 * at, and which the CIA's exheader already grants (app.rsf SystemCallAccess
 * GetSystemTick). On expiry the run writes an error naming the stage, the tick
 * and the frame's counters, then parks exactly as fail() does — the failure
 * becomes a file instead of a black screen.
 *
 * PV3DS_HOST_FRAME_WAIT_MS is the deadline, four seconds by default: about 240
 * frames, two orders of magnitude past the heaviest frame the diorama draws,
 * so a merely slow frame cannot reach it. It is measured in SYSTEM ticks, not
 * wall time, so an emulator that takes wall-clock seconds over one frame does
 * not approach it either. Zero expires immediately, which is the wedge drill.

 * the same run reported 92020 KiB of heap and 17881 KiB of linear memory free,
 * so neither the arena nor the heap is involved. NO ERROR FILE WAS WRITTEN:
 * the four-second deadline never expired, on a console that never ran another
 * frame. Every wedge drill on Azahar expired correctly. Hardware only.
 *
 * The deadline did not expire because the first version restarted it whenever
 * aptIsActive() read false, and that read is not the suspension test it looks
 * like. Two facts from libctru's source/services/apt.c:
 *
 *   FLAG_ACTIVE, the bit aptIsActive() returns, is written by exactly four
 *   functions — aptWaitForWakeUp, aptJumpToHomeMenu, aptLaunchLibraryApplet,
 *   aptLaunchSystemApplet — and every one of them runs on the thread that
 *   calls aptMainLoop(). The APT event-handler thread only sets
 *   FLAG_SHOULDSLEEP and the home-button state; it never touches FLAG_ACTIVE.
 *   So the bit cannot change while THIS thread sits in a wait between two
 *   aptMainLoop() calls, and a suspension cannot begin inside one of these
 *   waits: HOME and sleep both take effect in aptHandleJumpToHome and
 *   aptHandleSleep at the top of the frame loop, which is behind the wait. The
 *   check forgave nothing it was written to forgive.
 *
 *   The bit can also be false for a whole run. aptInit() returns early — before
 *   the aptWaitForWakeUp(TR_ENABLE) that first sets FLAG_ACTIVE — when
 *   aptIsCrippled(), which is RUNFLAG_APTWORKAROUND set and RUNFLAG_APTREINIT
 *   clear, the APT workaround some homebrew environments run titles under.
 *   There aptFlags stays 0 and aptIsActive() answers false from boot to exit.
 *   Under that launcher the restart ran on every poll and both deadlines were
 *   infinite. Azahar's loader does not set that run flag, which is exactly why
 *   the drills expired on the emulator and the console still hung. The boot
 *   line of memory.txt now prints runflags and apt, so which environment a
 *   console was in is a fact the next run leaves behind.
 *
 * So the deadline stops asking APT anything and measures the thing it actually
 * needs: was THIS THREAD running while the GPU was not? A wedged GPU does not
 * stop this thread — it keeps polling every PV3DS_HOST_POLL_GAP_MS, and every
 * gap between two polls is short. A process that is suspended, asleep, behind
 * an applet or frozen by the kernel does not execute this loop at all, so
 * however long that lasts it arrives as ONE long gap between two consecutive
 * polls. Each gap is therefore credited by its own length:
 *
 *   gap <= PV3DS_HOST_WAIT_STALL_MS   this thread ran     -> counts against
 *                                                            the deadline
 *   gap >  PV3DS_HOST_WAIT_STALL_MS   it did not run      -> counted apart,
 *                                                            never against it
 *
 * and the wait expires once the credited total reaches the deadline. The total
 * only ever grows, so every wait ends after a bounded amount of running time
 * whatever APT reports — which is what the console needed. A suspension still
 * costs the wait nothing, whatever its length, and that now covers the case
 * the APT bit never could: a freeze the process is never told about.
 *
 * PV3DS_HOST_WAIT_STALL_MS is 250 by default: 250x the poll gap, so a
 * scheduling hiccup is still counted as running, and far below any real
 * suspension, the shortest of which is a HOME transition of about a second.
 * A suspension shorter than the threshold is simply counted as running and
 * costs at most 250 ms of a 4000 ms deadline.
 *
 * The two are related and must stay that way: a poll gap at or above the stall
 * threshold makes every gap look like a suspension and no wait can ever
 * expire. Setting --poll-gap-ms above --wait-stall-ms on purpose is how the
 * suspended-run drill is staged, and the only reason to do it.
