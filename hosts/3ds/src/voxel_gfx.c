/*
 * The PICA200 command walker.
 *
 * `crates/pocketvoxel-pica` resolves a frame into a flat command stream, a
 * deduplicated matrix table and a set of texture keys; this file executes
 * that stream with citro3d. It makes no rendering decision of its own —
 * every palette, every atlas frame, every depth behaviour, every vertex was
 * decided by the core and lowered by the crate. What lives here is the GPU
 * state each command's flags stand for, and the two things the crate
 * deliberately leaves to the host: the screen tilt and the texture objects.
 *
 * The contract is `crates/pocketvoxel-pica/include/pocketvoxel_pica.h`; the
 * parity reasoning behind each state is `docs/PICA.md`.
 *
 * Three PICA200 facts shape the code:
 *
 *   - Vertex and index data must live in linearAlloc memory. BufInfo_Init
 *     writes base_paddr = 0x18000000, the base of FCRAM, and never moves it;
 *     BufInfo_Add rejects any buffer below it and stores the rest as offsets
 *     from it, and C3D_DrawElements subtracts the same constant from the index
 *     pointer. So both pools come out of the crate's one arena, and an index
 *     pointer osConvertVirtToPhys cannot resolve makes C3D_DrawElements return
 *     before emitting — a dropped draw, not a hung one (docs/PICA.md §2.4).
 *   - There is no fragment shader. Six TEV stages stand in: stage 0 does the
 *     work and the five behind it pass the result through.
 *   - There is no paletted texture format. Every (page, frame, palette,
 *     tinted) key is its own RGBA5551 image, expanded by the crate straight
 *     into the C3D_Tex's own linear buffer.
