//
// This runtime is ported to machines that differ by an order of magnitude in
// throughput, so fidelity is a LADDER a machine climbs, not a build flag. A
// host names the rung its hardware holds (`quality(tier)`) and the core reads
// that rung's dials out of `QUALITY` while it builds each frame.
//
// Every dial here is a RUNTIME dial: one cooked pak serves every rung, so the
// rung is a host decision and never a re-cook. Rungs are append-only exactly
// like op codes — a machine may be added, none may be renumbered — and the
// default rung is the WEAKEST one, so a host that never calls `quality` gets
// the cheapest frame rather than the dearest.
//
// **The top rung is the identity.** It draws what this runtime drew before
// the ladder existed, pixel for pixel; `tests/goldens/voxel/*-max.hashes` are
// the pre-ladder frame hashes, replayed at the top rung and asserted
// byte-for-byte, so no later rung edit can quietly move the picture the
// ladder is supposed to preserve. That is also why `chunkDist` holds
// `CHUNK_DRAW_DIST_PX` at every rung including the top: it is a pre-existing
// frame-budget cap being folded in from `draw.rs` (where it was the
// hard-coded `CULL_DIST`), not a new fidelity dial, and widening it at the
// top would draw MORE than the pre-ladder runtime rather than the same.
//
// Distances are world px, measured from the view centre to a chunk's own
// centre and widened by that chunk's half-extent. Every dial goes through the
// same arithmetic in `draw::within_dist`, so a dial added later cannot
// measure differently from the ones the goldens were recorded against.
//
// **A dial here is still a runtime dial when the GEOMETRY differs.** Tree LOD
// cooks BOTH levels of detail into every chunk — the carved hull in mesh kind
// `treeHull`, the same cells as plain boxes in `treeBox` — and the runtime
// picks one per chunk through `treeHullDist`. One pak still serves every rung.
// What the pak must then state is which levels it actually carries, and that
// is a META flag (`VXPK_META_FLAG_TREE_LOD`), not an entry in this table: a
// pak cooked without the box level renders every tree carved at every rung
// instead of misrendering, and a pak cooked with `VOXEL_TREE_BOXES=1` (the
// ladder's predecessor: a global cook switch) carries neither level and draws
// its boxes out of the terrain stream, as it always did.

 * coarse carve (`MESH_KIND.treeCoarse`, 2x2-px voxels, ~1/4 the quads with

 * (`MESH_KIND.treeBox`, under ten). Trees are the largest single item on the
 * ladder — fine hulls are 53 k of PALLET_TOWN's 97 k triangles at pitch rung
 * 2 and 34 k of ROUTE_1's 80 k, more than grass, flowers and water together,
 * and ROUTE_1 is a corridor whose trees are all NEAR, which is why the psp
 * rung's near level is the coarse carve (`treeHullDist: 0`): no distance
 * dial reaches near trees, only a cheaper carve does.
 *
 * `pullDepthBias` (0/1) changes HOW the pulled meshes (grass, flower) get
 * their camera-ward depth trick, not how many draw. Geometric pull — the
 * mod's own — displaces every vertex toward the eye along its own ray, which
 * on the PSP means re-staging every pulled vertex on the CPU each frame:
 * **measured 65-73 ms of a 100 ms Route-1 seam frame at ~1.15 µs per vertex**
 * (2026-08-06 autopilot, docs/VOXEL.md §4a). With the dial on, those meshes
 * draw their cooked vertices IN PLACE and the pull becomes one constant
 * NDC-depth bias per mesh, folded into the projection matrix
 * (`draw::depth_bias`) — zero per-vertex work. The bias is computed to equal
 * the geometric pull's depth shift exactly AT THE CAMERA FOCUS, which is the
 * player's own cell under the orbit rig and the arena centre under a battle
 * rig — precisely where grass-over-feet layering is a gameplay contract.
 * Away from the focus plane the bias drifts from the geometric value
 * sub-pixel-ward; the top rung keeps the geometric path, so the anchor
 * stands.
